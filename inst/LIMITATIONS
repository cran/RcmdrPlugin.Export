=== xtable() ===
- In the case of objects of class "numSummary", summarized by group, only the table for the first variable is exported ("Numerical summaries..")
- Before being passed to xtable(), arrays are not always, not necessarily converted in a best way. When the number of items contained in the array is elevated, the generated LaTeX table may well not fit an A4 portrait-oriented page ("Table of statistics..")
- Objects of class `"xtabs" "table"' are not necessarily treated correctly. With no conversion applied, only the table for the first variable is exported ("Multi-way table..")
- Objects of class "htest" cannot be exported
